            <p>If there is ONE PLAN that you should get as a fresh grad, <b>this is it</b>. There are probably more things that can land you in hospital than you think. Hospitalisation costs can easily amount to $10,000 (per day), which sadly is the entire net worth for some of us.</p>
            <p>There are different hospital plans you can choose from. If you are a baller and want some "luxury", go for private hospital plans. Else, Public hospital plans are good enough.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Private hospital ~$600/year: Have your own room, shorter waiting times</li>
                <li>Public hospital Class A ~$450/year: Own room, longer waiting time</li>
                <li>Public hospital Class B and below <$350/year: Shared room with >=3 other patients, longer waiting time</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you divide the premium cost into per day, its just ~$1 /day for Public Hospital, to protect you against having your entire bank account wiped out by a single day's stay in hospital. Best value for money imo.</p>

            <header>Life</header>
            <p>You buy life insurance so that if you die, at least your loved ones get money. You can also attach a critical-illness rider (aka. add on) to also cover critical illnesses like cancer and heart attack.</p>
            <p>There are two main types: Term vs Whole Life. Term plans cover you for specific number of years, if you die before your plan expiry, get money, else you get nothing. Whole Life covers, well, whole life, i.e. eventually when you die your family confirm will get the money.</p>
            <p>"Then doesn't Whole Life sound like a better deal?" It depends, here are some differences between the two types of plans:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Term plan premiums are way cheaper than Whole life - ~$100/year vs $2000/year</li>
                <li>Some Whole Life plans have "cash value", which means its like a savings account which earns some interest over time so you will get more money in the end</li>
                <li>There are whole life plans that only require premiums to be paid over a number of years e.g. 15 years, after which you don't pay anymore but still covered all the way. And premium/year doesn't change - the younger you are the cheaper.</li>
            </ul>
            <code>
                Top Tips: If you want to get a Whole Life plan e.g. 15 years premium, STOP PROCRASTINATING. Actually you should have bought once you turned 18 to lock in a cheap price.

            <header>Personal Accident</header>
            <p>Whether you buy this depends on how accident-prone you think you are. If your job/lifestyle puts you at higher physical risk (e.g. travelling around every day, playing contact sports on the weekends), then perhaps this is for you.</p>
            <p>Technically, many things can be considered as an "accident" depending on how you phrase it, e.g. stub your toe on the door hinge, food poisoning. You can also buy add ons to get paid if you take MC.</p>
            <code>
                Top Tips: Basic plans usually cost ~$150/year. If you get higher tier plans/add-ons, it can get up to ~$300/400, which means you probably need quite a few claims to make your money's worth. If you're buying >$600, you're probably wasting money.

            <header>Excessive Coverage</header>
            <p>As we all know, insurance agents make a living from taking a cut of the premiums you pay. Unsurprisingly then, some unscrupulous ones will try to upsell things that you don't even need. As an estimate, we should only spend up to 10% of our annual salary on insurance, so that it is within our means.</p>
            <p>Therefore, we need to be discerning and think for ourselves what we need/don't need. Don't need to "feel bad" for rejecting what your agent is trying to sell you just because he/she bought you a cuppa coffee at Starbucks. Some things you might not need:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Huge sum-assured/payouts upon claims. The size of sum-assured is proportional to premiums paid. As a guide, for critical illness plans, sum-assured should be 3x/4x your annual salary.</li>
                <li>Income Replacement plans. These come into play if you lose your job/ temporarily no income. You probably only need this further down the road when your earning power is higher and you have spouse/kids to take care of. When you are a fresh grad with an average salary without dependents, this plan may not be worth your money.</li>
            </ul>

            <header>Investment Products</header>
            <p>This is the category of plans that give some agents a bad rep.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1: Agents earn the largest commissions from selling ILPs compared to other products.</li>
                    <li>2: If you learn how to invest properly on your own, you are likely to make higher returns than ILPs due to the additional fees going to insurers.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>I have a feeling that most people who buy ILPs probably do not know much about investing/ do their own investing. And it is precisely this ignorance that could land them in situations being sold expensive and unsuitable products by agents.

            <p>If you don't have time to read all of the above, just know these 2 points:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most important plan you need to buy is HOSPITALISATION. Followed by Life and Personal Accident.</li>
                    <li>Do your due diligence before you sign anything, ask your friends and family whether what you're buying makes sense first. The more you ask the more you know.</li>
